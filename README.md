# Dental Disease Classification using ResNet from Scratch

## Project Overview
This project implements a **ResNet architecture from scratch** using TensorFlow to classify dental images into **7 categories of oral diseases**.

## Current Progress (Week 1)
- ✅ **Data Preprocessing**: Implemented image loading, resizing, and augmentation.
- ✅ **Data Visualization**: Created class distribution plots and sample displays.
- 🚧 **Model Architecture**: Building ResNet from scratch (in progress).
- ⏳ **Training & Evaluation**: To be completed.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dental-disease-classification-resnet.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the data loader test: `python src/data_loader.py`

## Notes
- The dataset (`Mouth_and_Oral_Diseases_dataset/`) is not included in this repository due to size and privacy.
